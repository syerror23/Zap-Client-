# Zap-Client-
This is just zap-client old version with old working aimbot, I updated the offsets here ya go.
Changelog below is not quite valid, the new update didnt work too well.








14.01.24 Update
Main Things:
    - Fixed Aimbot (Hopefully, play around with settings)
    - Fixed (most) config saving & loading
    - IGNORE the errors/numbers that show up in the terminal. To my experience, they dont interfere with the cheat (Something to do with weapons)
Aimbot:
    - Fixed Cubic Bezier (xap-client) Aimbot mode
    - Fixed Hotkeys
    - Added Deadzone to Cubic Bezier (Recommended: Less than 0.750)
Sense:
    - Fixed Saving issues
    - Name & TeamName ESP does not work

Plans for the next update:
    - Triggerbot Delay
    - Triggerbot Hitbox Selection (?)
    - Better Player Info Display Positions (Distance, Name, Weapon, Status ESP)
    - Name ESP Fix (?)
    - View Angles (See where players are aiming) (?)
    - UI Change & More Themes
